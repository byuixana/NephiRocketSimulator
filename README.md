# NephiRocketSimulator
A basic rocket simulator created using C++ and matplot.
# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This program uses the formulas for thrust, acceleration, and velocity to calculate the trajectory of a rocket in LEO (Low Earthen Orbit), MEO (Mid Earthen Orbit), and HEO (High Earthen Orbit).

The purpose of writing this software was to predict the path of a rocket based on its weight, acceleration, and thrust in a simulation.
