# NephiRocketSimulator
A basic rocket simulator created using C++ and matplot.
# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

This program uses the formulas for thrust, acceleration, and velocity to calculate the trajectory of a rocket in LEO (Low Earthen Orbit), MEO (Mid Earthen Orbit), and HEO (High Earthen Orbit).

The purpose of writing this software was to predict the path of a rocket based on its weight, acceleration, and thrust in a simulation.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

For this software, I used Visual Studio IDE, the C++ language, Github, and ChatGPT.

I built this software in C++ and the namespace std.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Add in a "Unload payload" function.
- Add matplot to retunr a rocket's trajectory.
- Add in burn rate.
